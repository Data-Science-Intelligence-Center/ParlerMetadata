# ParlerMetadata

Using the metadata from @donk_enby I have parsed the Parler post data down to videos with metadata stating a created date of 2021:01:06 (The date of the attack on the US Capitol). It also contains gps data when available and flags any posts that are in the DC Latitude.

To view the actual posts using google's cache just google: site:parler.com intext:"0lmypbT9naSL"
where "0lmypbT9naSL" is the post id you wish to retrieve
